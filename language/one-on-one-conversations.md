# One-on-One Conversations With Students

* Introduction

Any discusion of any teacher skill has to start with a reflection on
what it means to learn. As students we often entire a classroom with
the assumption that we are there to hear facts, but the teaching
community has become comfortable with the idea that learning is more
the result of an active process on the part of the student, rather
than passively receiving input from a teacher. Learning is an event in
the mind of the student resulting from its own action and not a
response to stimuli from an external agent. The role of the teacher in
a modern classroom is to profide and enviroment in which students are
likely to encounter the kinds of experiences necessary to acquire a
particular skill and not to communicate factual knowledge to a passive
audience.

This modern perspective, of course, is more align with the way we
learn naturally outside of a formal classroom setting. After all, we
teach our children to walk by doing it in front of them, giving them
the opportunity to try own their own, and encouraging them when they
make their first steps. They learn to talk the same way: through
direct experience of language. Almost all of the most important things
in life were taught to us by people simply giving us the opportunity
to have an authentic, active encounters with the subject.

As teachers we can look at magical, innate ability we all have to
learn these kinds of things and wonder at how we can emulate the same
process in our classrooms. These kinds of observations of natural
learning can form the foundation for classroom activities designed to
present students with authentic learning experiences. I want to think,
though, about the implications of this outside of the formal,
structured time we have to students. Instead, let's think about how we
can approach the spontaneous, unstructured, and informal student
interactions: the time with early-birds waiting for the day to start,
the after-class conversations sparked by tangental questions.

** Teaching as language

These kinds of conversations, in some ways, have the opportunity to be
the most like how humans learn in the wild. They tend to one-on-one
and they are driven by natural curiosity and genuine interpersonal
communication. On the other hand, the fact that they are unplanned
makes them harder to handle in a deliberate way and there's always the
danger that a critical chance for bonding will be wasted if we respond
clumsily. This is made all the more difficult by the fact that--for
the most part--the subjects we teach to adults center primarily around
conceptual learning. How can we, unprepared, provide students with an
authentic, natural experience of a differential equation, a quicksort
algorithm, or data-structure?

** Why think about conversations?
* What does constructivism mean for how we talk to students?
** Importance of active learning
** Less emphasis on conveying information
** Student-conversations as speech-action
** Answering questions with more questions
* Case study of the Meno
** Why are dialogues so prevelent in philogophy
** How can we create an experience of the abstract
** What are students really asking
* Aspects of productive conversations
** How can we learn to talk better?
** What is the real goal of a conversation?
** How can we see that a conversation worked?

# Observations about the Meno

* Meno starts the conversation
* Socrates affirms Meno's ability to descover the answer
* Socrates uses analogy
* Socrates reflects on how questions are answered
* Socrates demonstrates how to reason about a similar--but different--question
* Meno ultimately gives a definition of virtue
* Meno gets confused (think about the mention of Gorgias at the beginning)
* "There is no teaching, but only recollection"
* Confusion as a motivator
