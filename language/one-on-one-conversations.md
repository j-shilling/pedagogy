# One-on-One Conversations With Students

* Introduction

Like all first year teachers, I entered the world of education with the assumption that my role would be to communicate information to students. After all, that's what learning feels like--you start of not knowing anything about a topic and, as time goes on, you start to know things. Teaching, however, is a magic trick; it's sleight of hand. When we, as students, leave a great lesson, we've been bamboozeled--dooped into focusing on facts only tangental to the teachers real goal. The real learning happens without us noticing, without us feeling like we've been taught.

But, in those early days, my teaching was clumsy. There was no magic and hardly any learning. I had learned some of the sleight-of-hand techneques that would later become staples of my classroom, but I hadn't really grasped the importance of them at that point. I knew the mechanics of how to do these things, but didn't really understand *why* the more experienced teachers were using them because, at that time, I still thought of myself, the teacher, as the primary agent in the classroom. My students, on the other hand, I saw as passive NPCs who just needed to be told to learn often enough.

Of course, teachers are *not* the primary agents of their classrooms because *teaching* is not the primary action: *learning* is. We are the NPCs in one of their many side quests. Even though every mentor, every resource, told had told me ahead of time that learning was an active process, it still took some time in the classroom for me to really internalize the truth of it. 

** Teaching as language
** Why think about conversations?
* What does constructivism mean for how we talk to students?
** Importance of active learning
** Less emphasis on conveying information
** Student-conversations as speech-action
** Answering questions with more questions
* Case study of the Meno
** Why are dialogues so prevelent in philogophy
** How can we create an experience of the abstract
** What are students really asking
* Aspects of productive conversations
** How can we learn to talk better?
** What is the real goal of a conversation?
** How can we see that a conversation worked?

# Observations about the Meno

* Meno starts the conversation
* Socrates affirms Meno's ability to descover the answer
* Socrates uses analogy
* Socrates reflects on how questions are answered
* Socrates demonstrates how to reason about a similar--but different--question
* Meno ultimately gives a definition of virtue
* Meno gets confused (think about the mention of Gorgias at the beginning)
* "There is no teaching, but only recollection"
* Confusion as a motivator
